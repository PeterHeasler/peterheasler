### Situation
The web application was lacking a key feature that users were requesting, which was causing a drop in user engagement.

### Task
My task was to design and implement this new feature from scratch, ensuring it was user-friendly and integrated well with the existing application.

### Action
I started by gathering requirements and creating mockups. Then, I developed the feature using React and TypeScript. I also wrote unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of the code.

### Result
The new feature was successfully launched and was well-received by the users. User engagement increased by 15% in the first month after the launch.
